# zsh Shell Setup

### 1). Install zsh
Make sure that the zsh shell is available on your operating system. Once the shell is installed make
sure that zsh is set as the default. One way to do this is by adding the following line to the top
of your `~/.profile`.
```SHELL=/bin/zsh exec /bin/zsh --login```

### 2). Install 'oh-my-zsh'
TODO: Get install line from their website

### 3). Install 'powerlevel10k' font
NOTE: This install will be OS dependent. 

### 4). Install 'powerlevel10k' 
Install the powerlevel10k theme from GitHub as a custom 'oh-my-zsh' theme.

Update our `~/.zshrc` to set 'powerlevel10k' as the theme.
